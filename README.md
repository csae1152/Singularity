# Singularity
Just my personal thought on everything related to Singularity.

How far are we away from Singularity ?

My personal opinion is that we are far away from calling our computers/machines smart in the sense that human beeings are.

Of course computers can solve niche task much better than humans. Like Google DeepMind did it with AlphaGo. But this computer was trained exactly to performe very well for this task.
